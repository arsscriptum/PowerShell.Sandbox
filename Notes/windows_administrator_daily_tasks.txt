Repair the Connection
Click Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click Network Connections. Right-click the connection that you want to repair, and then click Repair.
The tasks that are performed by Network Connection Repair are the following:
Checks whether DHCP is enabled and, if enabled, sends a broadcast DHCPRequest message to refresh the IPv4 address configuration.
Flushes the ARP cache. This is equivalent to the arp -d * command.
Flushes and reloads the DNS client resolver cache with entries from the Hosts file. This is equivalent to the ipconfig /flushdns command.
Re-registers DNS names using DNS dynamic update. This is equivalent to the ipconfig /registerdns command.
Flushes and reloads the NetBIOS name cache with #PRE entries in the Lmhosts file. This is equivalent to the nbtstat -R command.
Releases and then re-registers NetBIOS names with the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). This is equivalent to the nbtstat -RR command.

Verify Configuration
ipconfig /all
The display of the ipconfig /all command includes IPv4 addresses, default gateways, and DNS settings for all interfaces. The Ipconfig tool only works on the local computer.

Troubleshooting IPv6
Troubleshooting IPv6
The following sections describe the tools and techniques used to identify a problem at successive layers of the TCP/IP protocol stack using an IPv6 Internet layer. Depending on the type of problem, you might do one of the following:
Start at the bottom of the stack and move up.
Start at the top of the stack and move down.

The following sections are organized from the top of the stack
Verify IPv6 connectivity.
Verify DNS name resolution for IPv6 addresses.
Verify IPv6-based TCP sessions.

Verifying IPv6 Connectivity
the tasks to troubleshoot problems with IPv6 connectivity:
Verify configuration
Manage configuration
Verify reachability
View and manage the IPv6 routing table
Verify router reliability


Verify Configuration
ipconfig /all
includes IPv6 addresses, default routers, and DNS settings for all interfaces
netsh interface ipv6 show address
displays the IPv6 addresses assigned to each interface
netsh –r filesrv1 interface ipv6 show address
display the configuration of the remote computer named FILESRV1

Manage Configuration
netsh interface ipv6 set address 
manually configure IPv6 addresses

netsh interface ipv6 set interface
make changes to the configuration of IPv6 interfaces
netsh interface ipv6 add dns
add the IPv6 addresses of DNS servers
option of the Netsh tool to manage the IPv6 configuration of a remote computer
 –r RemoteComputerName 
 

Verify Reachability
Check and flush the neighbor cache
netsh interface ipv6 show neighbors
display the current contents of the neighbor cache
netsh interface ipv6 delete neighbors
flush the neighbor cache
Check and flush the destination cache
netsh interface ipv6 show destinationcache
display the current contents of the destination cache
netsh interface ipv6 delete destinationcache
flush the destination cache
Ping the default router
obtain the link-local IPv6 address of your default router
ipconfig
netsh interface ipv6 show routes
route print
nbtstat -r
When you ping the default router, you must specify the zone identifier (ID) for the interface on which you want the ICMPv6 Echo Request messages to be sent
The zone ID is the interface index of the default route (::/0) with the lowest metric
This step might not succeed if the default router is filtering all ICMPv6 messages.
netsh interface ipv6 show route
route print
Ping a remote destination by its IPv6 address
tracert –d IPv6Address
trace the routing path to the remote destination
–d command line option prevents the Tracert tool from performing a DNS reverse query on every near-side router interface in the routing path, which speeds up the display of the routing path
Check Packet Filtering
IPsec for IPv6 policies that have been configured with the Ipsec6 tool
The simple IPv6 firewall
Windows Firewall


View and Manage the Local IPv6 Routing Table
view the IPv6 routing table
route print
netstat –r
netsh interface ipv6 show route
add a route to the IPv6 routing table
netsh interface ipv6 add route
modify an existing route
netsh interface ipv6 set route
remove an existing route
netsh interface ipv6 delete route

Verify Router Reliability
trace the path to a destination and display information on packet losses for each router and link in the path
–d command line option prevents the Pathping tool from performing a DNS reverse query on every near-side router interface in the routing path, which speeds up the display of the routing path.
pathping –d IPv6Address


Verifying DNS Name Resolution for IPv6 Addresses
the following tasks to troubleshoot problems with DNS name resolution
Verify DNS configuration
Display and flush the DNS client resolver cache
Test DNS name resolution with the Ping tool
Use the Nslookup tool to view DNS server responses

Verify DNS Configuration
On the node having DNS name resolution problems, verify the following:
Host name
The primary DNS suffix
DNS suffix search list
Connection-specific DNS suffixes
DNS servers
obtain this information
ipconfig /all
obtain information about which DNS names should be registered in DNS
netsh interface ip show dns
add the IPv6 addresses of additional DNS servers
netsh interface ipv6 add dns
register the appropriate DNS names as IPv6 address resource records (also known as AAAA resource records) with DNS dynamic update,
ipconfig /registerdns


Display and Flush the DNS Client Resolver Cache
display the contents of the DNS client resolver cache
ipconfig /displaydns
flush the contents of the DNS client resolver cache and reload it with the entries in the Hosts file
ipconfig /flushdns

Test DNS Name Resolution with Ping
To test DNS name resolution, use the Ping tool and ping a destination by its host name or FQDN. The Ping tool display shows the FQDN and its corresponding IPv6 address.

Use the Nslookup Tool to View DNS Server Responses
If the Ping tool is using the wrong IPv6 address, flush the DNS client resolver cache and use the Nslookup tool to determine the set of addresses returned in the DNS Name Query Response message
At the Nslookup > prompt, use the set d2
display the maximum amount of information about the DNS response messages
use Nslookup to look up the desired FQDN. 
Look for AAAA records in the detailed display of the DNS response messages.


Verifying IPv6-based TCP Sessions
If reachability and name resolution are working but you cannot establish a TCP connection with a destination host, use the following tasks:
Check for packet filtering
Verify TCP connection establishment
 
Verify TCP Session Establishment
verify that a TCP connection can be established using a known destination TCP port number
telnet IPv6Address TCPPort
verify whether the Web server service on the computer with the IPv6 address of 3FFE:FFFF::21AD:2AA:FF:FE31:AC89 is accepting TCP connections on TCP port 80
telnet 3ffe:ffff::21ad:2aa:ff:fe31:ac89 80
